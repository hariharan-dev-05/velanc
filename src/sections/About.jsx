            I am Velan, a passionate Artificial Intelligence Engineer and
            Mechanical Engineer with a strong background in Computational Fluid
            Dynamics (CFD) and AI-driven engineering solutions. My expertise
            lies in bridging the gap between traditional engineering principles
            and cutting-edge AI methodologies to drive innovation in mechanical
            design, simulation, and predictive modeling.

            Currently, I am pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial
            Intelligence at Sheffield Hallam University, where I am exploring
            advanced machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision
            techniques. My research focuses on applying Physics-Informed Neural
            Networks (PINNs) in CFD, specifically in turbulence modeling and
            combustion simulations.
